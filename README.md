# Operator-Overloading-in-VHDL
Operator overloading is very useful property that is commonly used in VHDL libraries.
I have added some useful functions with used defined data types. 
Note that, VHDL 2008 must be used.
The features I have used is not supported in Vivado simulator. Modelsim simulator works fine.
