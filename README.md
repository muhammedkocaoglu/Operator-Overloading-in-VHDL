# Operator-Overloading-in-VHDL
Operator overloading is very useful property that is commonly used in VHDL libraries. <br />
I have added some useful functions with used defined data types.  <br />
Note that, VHDL 2008 must be used. <br />
The features I have used are not supported in Vivado simulator. Modelsim simulator works fine. <br />
